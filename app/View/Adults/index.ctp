		<p>Chamois, pronounced sha-moi, is a purebred, AKC registered, 65lb. Golden Retriever.</p>
		<p>She is a beautiful, intelligent dog with a gentle temperament and she prefers human attention over anything else. We have a 3 acre fenced field where she loves to run, explore and play with our other dogs. Besides playing, my favorite time with Chamois is to just relax and pet her soft head and chest.</p>

		<p>Bridgette is a purebred AKC English Creme Golden Retriever. She has an amazing pedigree with many champions throughout all four of her grandparent lines. Her sire is an English Golden with a heritage from France with many titles there. Her English Golden mother's line is from Romania and the United Kingdom with many titles as well.</p>
		<p>The English Golden Retriever is similar to the American Golden Retriever with a few differences. More of the American Goldens are still bred for retrieving and hunting and so will have a higher energy level for performance in the field though they are gentle and calm compared to many other breeds. English Goldens are mainly bred for the perfection of breed standards such as intelligence, body conformation, color and sound temperament. The English are generally calmer, stockier(more compact) and lighter in color.</p>
		<p>The lighter cream colors are not standard for the AKC (American) show ring, but are accepted and common for the show dogs in Europe which gives the English retrievers the butter to cream colors.</p>
		<p>She loves to play with the children, our other dogs and swimming. She is very intelligent and quite the companion I love to have around!</p>

		<p>Zoe is one of our puppies from Jade and Desmond. Biscuit, her brother, is pictured on the Past Litters page.</p>
		<p>She is my first Goldendoodle and I absolutely love her! I love my Goldens and Poodles, but there is something extra special about her. Mostly because I raised her as a baby and she is such a Teddy bear! She is very smart and has been easy to train. She focuses on me and responds right away when corrected or called.</p>
		<p>Zoe is a first generation Goldendoodle and when she is bred with a Poodle the puppies will be called F1b Goldendoodles. An F1b is a puppy from a Goldendoodle bred with a Poodle for a 25% Golden Retriever/ 75% Poodle. These puppies are ideal for those with more severe allergies who are wanting some of that wonderful Golden Retriever rather than a pure bred Poodle.</p>
		<p>Another difference is these puppies will be smaller than our other Goldendoodles because they will be bred a second generation to a 12 lb Poodle. Zoe and her siblings average 30-35 lbs at 1 year old. Zoe's F1b puppies will most likely average 20 lbs at 1 year old.</p>

		<p>Budro is a white 12 lb. Poodle with a fun affectionate personality. His name is officially spelled Boudreaux, but we will use the spelling Budro to keep things simple. His parents and their lines are all champions as well as all white in color. I specifically have Budro to sire with Bridgette because she is an English Golden Retriever also with many champions in her pedigree as well as the cream to white colors.</p>
